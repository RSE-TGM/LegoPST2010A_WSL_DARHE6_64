Welcome! 

The following package is the patched version of the free DCE 
implementation for Linux to be found on sourceforge. This package
is expected to work on many recents Linux distribution on 
32/64 little endian architecture ( should work on big endian too,
but it didn't tested so far ).

It is used in particular at the Deutsche Flugsicherung 
(German Air Navigation Service).



===================
Supported platforms 
===================

IA32 Linux 
  The package has been compiled with gcc2.95, gcc 3.2.2, gcc 3.3.2
  using glibc 2.2.5, 2.3.x.  
  using LinuxThreads 0.8/0.9/0.10 and NPTL 0.29/0.34/0.59/0.61
  It has been tested on Mandrake v9.1 and Suse v7.3. 
  It has been tested on Fedora Core 1, 
  It has been tested on SuSE v9.0,
  It has been tested on SuSE v9.1,
  It has been tested on Fedora Core 2 and 3 

Alpha Linux
  The package has been compiled with gcc 3.2.3. It has been 
  tested on an Alpha running Debian Linux 3.0 

AMD64 Linux
  The package has been compiled with gcc 3.3.2 using the newest glibc 2.3.x.  
  It has been tested on Fedora Core 3 

One should be able to compile this package with gcc 2.95 or above 
on a wide range of Linux platforms. If it fails on your favorite 
Linux platform, contact the maintainers.

Compiling / Installation
========================

1- Install first the dcethreads package. For this, proceed as follows:

	1.1 go to the dcethreads directory:
	    cd dcethreads
	    
	1.2 run the configure script:
	    ./configure

	1.3 compile the package:
	    make
	
	1.4 as ROOT, install the package:
	    su
	    umask 022 # zero-two-two
	    make install

	1.5 unlog as ROOT, and go back to this directory:
	    cd ..
	    

2- Install next the freedce package. For this, proceed as follows:

        2.1 go to the freedce directory:
	    cd freedce

	    make install
