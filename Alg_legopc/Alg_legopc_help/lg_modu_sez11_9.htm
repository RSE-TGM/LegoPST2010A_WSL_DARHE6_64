<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sometimes one may need to insert in LEGO
simulator a special component which has been modelled using a different
simulation strategy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If the model is easy, the best way is to
realize a LEGO process module whose equations are the same of the non LEGO model
(obviously, this is not the most frequent case :-). If the model is very
complicated, the best way is not to realize a LEGO module shell, but to link the
non LEGO model as a separate task in the simulator: the LEGOCAD system allows
the connection between LEGO and non LEGO tasks in the same simulator.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Only if the model is neither very easy
nor very complicated, it may be convenient to realize a LEGO shell which calls
the non LEGO model.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The LEGO shells (which should not have
more than 40 outputs and 100 total variables) may uses iterative (state and/or
algebraic) outputs and/or non iterative outputs (see also the related section).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The shell must also manage the exchange
between LEGO and non LEGO variables, as in the LEGO environment the only
recorded variables are the DATI and the XYU vector. The usage of common areas to
store static variables are not allowed, as the values will be mutually modified
between the different instances of the module (it is allowed only for modules
which cannot be present more than once in the same LEGO model: it depends on the
kind of component modelled).</span></p>
