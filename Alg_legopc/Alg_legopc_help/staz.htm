<p ALIGN="CENTER">IMPULSE STAGE OF STEAM TURBINE</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The STAZ module simulates the behaviour of an impulse stage of
steam turbine; it belongs to the thermodynamic standard library.</p>
<p align="left">As impulse stage is intended a stage in which the conversion of
enthalpy possessed by steam into kinetic energy exclusively occurs in guide
blading (also called stator or nozzle arch). The kinetic energy acquired by
steam is transferred to bucket blading (rotor). Usually only the first stage of
an high pressure turbine consists of one impulse stage. On the contrary, both in
following stages of high pressure turbine and those having mean and low pressure
generally are reaction stages. In the last one a further conversion of enthalpy
energy on bucket blading is obtained.</p>
<p align="left">By using a merely thermodynamic statement, the STAZ module
simulates the functioning of the steam turbine impulse stage. In particular it
simulates the first stage of an high pressure turbine known as control stage. In
fact in the STAZ module is included whole inlet steam system into the turbine
(inlet valves, piping feeding the sector in which nozzle arch is subdivided and
related regulating valves).</p>
<p align="left">From a structural point of view, steam inlet system into the
turbine consists of one or more inlet pipes which let in steam into different
feeding pipes equipped with one's regulating valve. Each feeding pipe is
connected with a particular sector of nozzle arch (see figure 1).</p>
</font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="images/Image725.gif" width="364" height="253"></p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">figure 1</p>
<p align="left">The model is based on the following main hypotheses:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- steam behaviour is assimilate to a perfect gas one</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- absence of accumulation phenomenon (mass, momentum, energy) in
the system</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- absence of thermal exchange between steam and metallic surface
of connection pipes</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- isenthalpic expansion of steam up to inlet into the nozzles</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- head losses along connection piping are supposed to be
concentrated in regulating valves and consequently at their outlet the pressure
is coincident with pressure at the nozzle inlet.</p>
<p align="left">A further detailed discussion about validity of the above
mentioned hypotheses is available in &quot;Turbine Mathematical Model in
Temperature Calculation of Steam Inside the Impulse Rotor Chamber&quot; by
R.Terrazzani, A.Beato and M.Colombini published by ENEL Milano October 1979. A
synthesis is carried out in the module theoretical documentation.</p>
<p align="left">Steam turbines usually have two inlet pipes. The STAZ module
allows to operate with two inlet valves to connect with two steam inlet piping.
So, it is possible to reproduce the actual configuration or use only one inlet
valve connected with only one equivalent inlet piping. This configuration can be
used when are not interesting the problems concerning the feeding dissymmetry.</p>
<p align="left">For every feeding piping in parallel configuration the flow rate
is calculated as regards to:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- opening and geometry of regulating valve associated to the
piping</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- nozzles geometry</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- enthalpy and pressure upstream the inlet valve</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- pressure at nozzles outlet, so in rotor chamber.</p>
<p align="left">It is useful to note that the model takes into account the
possibility in which valves and/or nozzles are under critical functioning
conditions (sonic conditions).</p>
<p align="left">As already mentioned, in determining the state evolution of
steam along every feeding piping, the expansion into the regulating valve is
considered isenthalpic. On the contrary, enthalpy at the nozzle outlet is
calculated beginning from the inlet one (valve outlet), by using the
thermodynamic efficiency definition of steam transformation which is considered
almost isenthropic. In this way it is possible to quantify the efficiency as
quadratic function of ratio between the revolving speed of a turbine blade
median point and the absolute speed of steam at the nozzles outlet. The enthalpy
in rotor chambers is then calculated mixing the enthalpies of different pipes.</p>
<p align="left">Once calculated the quantities interesting every single feeding
piping, the quantities characterizing the stage total behaviour are calculated
too.</p>
<p align="left">On the basis of assigned manufacturing and functioning
characteristics as well as some boundary thermodynamic and physical conditions
(like pressure and enthalpy of supplied steam and its pressure inside the rotor)
the following are calculated:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- values of flow rate flowing into the stage</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- enthalpy value inside the rotor chamber</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- mechanic power generated in the stage.</p>
<p align="left">Two functioning conditions are possible:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- start-up: when turbine revolving speed is variable and the
turbine is uncoupled from alternator (see note 1)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- running: when turbine revolving speed is constant and the
turbine is coupled with alternator.</p>
<p align="left">Two different conditions of turbine feeding are foreseen:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- steam inlet on whole nozzle ring synchronizing the opening of
regulating valves (functioning in total arc)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- steam inlet in a gradual manner on different nozzle ring
sectors, by opening regulating valves with a suitably sequence (functioning in
partial arc).</p>
<p align="left">During start-up and under low loads (when considerable thermal
shocks on the turbine could be caused by a sequence feeding), the total arc
functioning is used.</p>
<p align="left">Under transient condition the module also allows the changeover
from total to partial arc functioning and vice versa.</p>
<p align="left">The first five residual equations are related to overall
quantities characterizing the whole stage. The utilized equations are:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">1) calculation equation of total flow rate flowing into the
stage</p>
<p ALIGN="left">2) calculation equation of enthalpy in the rotor chamber</p>
<p ALIGN="left">3) calculation equation of power generated inside the stage</p>
<p ALIGN="left">4) calculation equation of flow rate flowing through the nozzle
arc sectors fed by the first feeding piping</p>
<p ALIGN="left">5) calculation equation of flow rate flowing through the nozzle
arc sectors fed by the (possible) second feeding piping.</p>
<p align="left">It is useful to precise the meanings of WAM1 and WAM2 flow rates
calculated through the equations 4 and 5. Each of these flow rates (in case of
two inlet piping) represents the total flow rate flowing through these nozzle
arc sectors fed by the same inlet piping. In particular an half nozzle arc
sector is assigned to each inlet piping. Even if only one inlet piping is
considered, the calculation of WAM1 and WAM2 flow rate keeps separate. In this
case each of them has merely the meaning of the flow rate flowing through half
nozzle arc.</p>
<p align="left">Among own output variables, the module also has the pressure
upstream nozzles and the position of regulating valves. To each of these output
variables does not correspond an equation solved by LEGO code simultaneously
with rest part of the system. Therefore in coupling these output variables with
input ones, coming from other modules, some precaution are required.</p>
<p align="left">To simulate the whole turbine, besides the STAZ module, also the
TREN module simulating reaction stages has to be used. Bleedings in a reaction
stage are simulated by a suitable use of VALV or SPIL modules (see related
documents).</p>
<p align="left">When the simulation is referred to a start-up condition the MART
module has to be utilized too. This module evaluates the (possible) turbine
speed variation (during transient condition) taking into account the turbine
inertia and its generated mechanics power. In start-up simulation, use of a
model representing the turbine speed regulation is also required (see note 1 for
a description of start-up conditions).</p>
<p align="left">A monitoring of metal temperature both for casing and rotor can
be done by using the nozzles upstream pressure and utilizing the FLEX, TSML and
MEST modules.</p>
<p align="left">The FLEX module determines the temperature and thermal exchange
coefficient of steam by using pressure and enthalpy values upstream the
regulating valves of flow rate flowing into the stage. Afterwards, the TSML and
MEST modules calculate the thermal range on casing and rotor and, for the last
one, is also calculated the wear consequent to a fixed transient.</p>
<p align="left">The STAZ module includes the data needing in simulating of
control stages related to the following turbines:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- TOSI (320 and 660 MW)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- ANSALDO (320 MW).</p>
<p align="left">If different turbine control stages has to be simulate, user
must built a subprogram including data concerning the quantities listed in
section on physical and geometrical data, in accordance with &quot;User
subprograms&quot; section. In building such subroutine user can imitate one of
those related to the three control stages carried out in &quot;Data acquisition
subroutines&quot; section.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="RIGHT">Note 1</p>
</b>
<p align="left">Progressive and controlled heating of turbine different parts is
the basic problem during start-up operations.</p>
<p align="left">Time required in starting the machine, to reach full load
conditions, is determined by needs to obtain its progressive heating. This means
that a progressive inlet of steam into the turbine has to be carried out both in
thermal stabilization periods (with revolving speed lower than target one), and
in slow increasing load after paralleling.</p>
<p align="left">During start-up operations the following conditions are met: at
the beginning inlet and regulating valves must be closed.</p>
<p align="left">The turbine is driven by a barring device with an angular speed
equal to few runs per minute.</p>
<p align="left">In machine resetting is automatically arranged the speed control
by means of inlet valves while regulating valves are fully opened. When the
fixed speed is set up by operator, speed default (difference between pre-set and
actual speed), suitably increased, controls the inlet valves opening. To higher
and higher set up speeds corresponds a progressive opening of inlet valves as
well as increased steam flow rate into the turbine.</p>
<p align="left">When turbine speed is close to 2700 rpm (nominal speed), the
operator actuates the speed regulation changeover from inlet valves to
regulating ones.</p>
<p align="left">Steam flow rate which allows to keep constant the turbine speed
(2700 rpm) is the WAVV flow rate mentioned in physical and geometrical data
section. The corresponding inlet valve lift is the ZETAM quantity mentioned in
same section.</p>
<p align="left">Inlet valve fully open while, at the same time, regulating
valves begin to close so that a speed regulation is assured.</p>
<p align="left">Speed regulation changeover from inlet valves to regulating
ones, is carried out through a suitable control of electrohydraulic regulation
system.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Afterwards, when target speed is reached, the parallel coupling
with network is carried out. Start-up operations can be considered settled.</p>

<p align="left">The quantities ZETAM, PAVV, HAVV and WAVV thereinafter mentioned
characterize the behaviour of turbine inlet valves. On this subject it is useful
to precise how inlet valve can be described as consisting of two valves. The
smaller one (pilot valve) is used for turbine start-up whereas the bigger one is
the real on-off valve. In the first lift step (values from zero to ZETAM) the
valve discharge coefficient is the pilot valve one and for higher values it is
the on-off valve one.</p>
<p align="left">The quantities ZETAM, PAVV and HAVV defines the inlet valve
dimensioning in agreement with the fully opening of pilot valve that is for a
ZETAM opening value by using the following relation:</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">CVA(ZETAM) = WAVV/SQRT(1-R)/SQRT(PAVV*ROAV)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">where:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- R indicates the so called critical ratio (a constant in the
adopted model)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- ROAV is the density value corresponding to HAVV and PAVV</p>
<p ALIGN="left">- CVA is the valve discharge capacity (to avoid possible
misunderstanding it is perhaps useful to emphasize that CVA has the meaning of
the specific discharge capacity per the valve cross section area).</p>

<p align="left">From a normal point of view, residual the number of present
residuals is not fixed up but it varies at varying of number of regulating
valves. Nevertheless, the first five residuals are fixed up, independent from
number of regulating valves and constitute the actual module equations.</p>
<p align="left">The first residual has the following form:</p>
<p align="center">RNI(1) = (WAMM-WAM1-WAM2)</p>
<p align="right">(normalization factor = W0)</p>
<p align="left">The residual RNI(2) has the following form:</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">RNI(2) = (HCRT - HMISC)</p>
<p ALIGN="RIGHT">(normalization factor = H0/100)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">where HMISC has the meaning of the enthalpy obtained by mixing
enthalpies of flow rate flowing on the different nozzles arc sectors.</p>
<p align="left">The residual RNI(3) has two different expressions as a function
of the considered number of inlet piping. So, in case of only one inlet piping:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="center">RNI(3) = QMEC-WAMM*(HAMM-HCRT)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="RIGHT">(normalization factor = W0*H0)</p>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="RIGHT">(normalization factor = W0*H0)</p>
<p>The residual RNI(4) can be formally written as:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- only one inlet piping</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="center">RNI(4) = WAM1 - f4(PAMM, HAMM, ALZS, FARC, PCRT)</p>

<p>Similarly, the RNI(5) residual can be formally written as:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- only one inlet piping</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="center">RNI(5) = WAM2 - f5(PAMM, HAMM, ALZS, FARC, PCRT)</p>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="RIGHT">(normalization factor = W0)</p>
<p align="left">Remaining residuals equations can be used for monitoring the
values of the i-th regulating valve lift and upstream pressure of arc sector
supplied by the i-th regulating valve. So the NVALV equation for lifts and NVALV
equations for the pressures are present.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">RNI(5+i) = AR_i - f(ALZS, FARC) i = 1...NVALV</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">RNI(5+NVALV+i) = PU_i - f(PAM, HAM, PCRT, ALZS, FARC) i = 1...NVALV</p>
