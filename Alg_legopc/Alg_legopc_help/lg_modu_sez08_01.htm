for Jacobian matrix topology setting?</font></i></b></span><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When IFUN is 1 &quot;xxxxC1&quot; must
assign the topology of the Jacobian matrix during transients simulation. The
subroutine must assign to the AJAC array elements 1. or 0. values whose meaning
is whether the row-indicated equation's residual depends (1.) or doesn't depend
(0.) from the column-indicated block variable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As zero is the default value for AJAC's
elements, only ones have to be assigned.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In transients simulations, only the
terms of Jacobian matrix pointed by non-zero elements of Jacobian topology are
used to solve the differential-algebraic system: the other terms are neglected,
also if they are not zero (it means: also if there actually were an influence of
the related variable on the related residual). So, if the module's developers is
not absolutely sure that there is no influence, it is better to set the 1. value
also for terms where the influence could not be present: the easiest solution is
to set as 1. all the elements of the topology!</span></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:IT;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Obviously
this is only the easiest solution, but is not the best one: setting to 1.
elements related to variables which don't have ever any influence on the
row-indicated residual may hardly increase the computing times and the memory
storage requirements (only the non-zero elements of Jacobian matrix are stored
and used during differential-algebraic system solving, as it is a
&quot;sparse&quot; matrix - a matrix where only a few elements are non-zero).</span>
