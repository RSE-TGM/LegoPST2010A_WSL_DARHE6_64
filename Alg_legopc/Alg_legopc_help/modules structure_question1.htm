<p ALIGN="left">LEGO process modules has to simulate the
physical or mathematical behaviour of a plant component, 
or to realize some special function (like algebraic sums) 
in a process simulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">At the moment, a lot of LEGO standard
modules (which can simulate every component in standard 
thermoelectric and thermonuclear plants) has been developed 
and tested. So, if the user has not to simulate a non-standard 
size electrical power plant, he (almost surely) won't
have any needing to realize new process modules.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But LEGOCAD system and LEGO code have
been often used also to simulate non-electrical plants 
(hot strip milling plants, robots, pipe nets, etc...): 
if one has to simulate with LEGOCAD system a non-electrical 
plant, he will have to realize his own library.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Besides, someone can also have to realize 
a part of an electrical plant model with more or less accuracy than
standard LEGO libraries do.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">For example, if one has only to simulate
an auxiliary subsystem, which takes water from the degasifier 
of an electric plant, it's not a good idea to simulate the dynamic 
behaviour of the degasifier, because he should have to simulate also 
part of the condensate and the feed water subsystems and their regulation
models: it's more easy to realize a very simple module which computes 
the saturation enthalpy of water given the degasifier pressure! 
Maybe enthalpy of water in the degasifier is not exactly
equal to saturation enthalpy, but this effect is quite surely negligible 
for the auxiliary subsystem to be simulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">On the contrary, very fast transients in long water pipes 
(when also water compressibility and pipe's metal deformation shall be 
taken into account) can not be simulated with standard library modules.</p>
