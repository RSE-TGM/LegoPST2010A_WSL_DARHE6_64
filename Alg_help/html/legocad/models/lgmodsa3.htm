</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The model maker can't have any doubt about the modules to be used to simulate the pump and the valve: the librarian module for the pump is CPOM and the librarian module for the valve is VALV.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But these modules can be istanciated in several different configurartions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the pump, the first selection is between an imposed-speed pump and a motor-power-imposed pump. Assuming we are not interested in the simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the pump rotational speed, the imposed-speed model will be choosen.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both for the PUMP and the VALV modules, the model maker must also select the hydraulical output variable: fluid flow rate, inlet pressure or outlet pressure. This choice can be made only after the selection of the module (or the modules) used for the water/flue gas heat exchanger. Note that for these kind of modules, the better choice, which may not cause numerical problems to the simulator in every working condition, is always the "flow-rate-output" choice. So we will try to build the rest of the model in order to allow the pump and the valve evaluate their throwing fluid flow rate.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica" SIZE=6><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="lg_model_sample3_b"></A>Example 3 - exchanger modelization</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all the check of the LEGO libraries easily make the model-maker realize that in this case is not possible to simulate this plant component with only one LEGO module, as no library module can simulate every hydraulical and thermo-dynamical phenomena of such kind of exchangers. Actually a module able to simulate a whole boiling exchanger will be a very complicated and a very inconvenient to be used.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exchanger can be divided into file sub-components:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the water inlet manifold;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the exchanger pipe bundle (water side);</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the metal walls of the pipe bundle;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the external side of the pipe bundle (flue gases side);</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the steam outlet manifold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the LEGO libraries one can find the LEGO module which simulates both the water side and the metal walls of the pipe bundle (the EXCH module) and the LEGO module which simulates the thermo-dynamical behaviour of the flue gases side (the FUMN module). Obviously the EXCH and the FUMN modules have been developed in order to easily allow their direct connection (no auxiliary module is so required to build the model of the exchanger).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using the FUMN module, one does not simulate the hydraulical model of the flue gas duct, as usually in LEGO models the hydraylical and the termal behaviour of the flue gas ducts are simulated separately. In the building of the topology of this example we will neglect the hydraulical behaviour of the flue gas duct.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EXCH and the FUMN modules are "cellized" modules. A cellized module is a module which allows the user to select (inside a certain range) the number of "lumped parameters" cells in order to better approximate the actual behaviour of the exchanger.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a four-passes exchanger (like the one drawed in the previous picture) the most obvious choice is to select exactly four cells both for the EXCH and for the FUMN module. But if we better look at the EXCH module, we can see that the main hydraulical output variables are the inlet flow rate and the outlet pressure, while the inlet pressure and the outlet flow rate are input variables. In order to allow both the inlet pump and the outlet valve to evaluate their fluid flow rate as output variables, the VALV module could be directly connected to the downstream side of the EXCH, while an intermediate manifold must be placed between the pump and the upstream side of the exchanger.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case, the outlet manifold can be simulated simply adding a cell to the EXCH module. This cell will not exchange heat with the flue gas duct, but with the environment; the extrenal side (air side) thermal exchanging coefficient must be imposed by the model maker depending on the manifold size and the kind of cohibentation. On the contrary, for the inlet manifold the model maker will use the COLT module, like in the first example: in this case, one inlet branch and one outlet brach are present.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to obtain the described model for the exchanger, the FUMN module will be instanciated selecting four cells and the EXCH module with five cells (the last one representing the outlet manifold).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EXCH and the FUMN module also allows the user to let every cell exchange heat with more different cells on the other side, belonging or not belonging to the same block. It means that one cell of an EXCH module may exchange heat with more FUMN cells, and one FUMN cell may exchange heat with more EXCH cells. In this example, this feature of the EXCH and FUMN module will not be used, so the model maker will impose only one exchanging zone (EXCH) or surface (FUMN) for each cell.</P>
